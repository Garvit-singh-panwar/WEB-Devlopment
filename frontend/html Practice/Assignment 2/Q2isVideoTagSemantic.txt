Q2 IS video tag a semantic tag ?
Yes, the `<video>` tag is considered **semantic** in HTML. Here's why:

### What Makes It Semantic?
A **semantic tag** clearly describes its meaning and purpose to both the browser and developers. The `<video>` tag:
- **Indicates purpose**: It explicitly tells the browser and developers that the content inside it is a video.
- **Improves accessibility**: Assistive technologies (like screen readers) recognize `<video>` and understand that it contains video content.
- **Readable code**: Makes the structure of the webpage easier to understand by looking at the tags used.

### Why It’s Important
Using semantic tags like `<video>` helps:
- Search engines understand and index the content better.
- Web accessibility tools provide a better user experience.
- Developers maintain and debug code more easily.

For comparison, using a `<div>` with video-related attributes would not be semantic, as it doesn’t convey the meaning of its content.

In short, yes, `<video>` is semantic, and it’s good practice to use it when embedding videos!
