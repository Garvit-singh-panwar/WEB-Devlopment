search on the internet & learn to use video tag in html .(simmilar to img tag)


The `<video>` tag in HTML is used to embed video content on a webpage. It's one of the multimedia elements introduced in HTML5. Hereâ€™s everything you need to know in simple terms:

---

### Basic Syntax
```html
<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

---

### Key Features
1. **Self-contained**: It doesn't need external plugins (like Flash) to work. Modern browsers can play videos directly.
2. **Attributes**: You can customize how the video behaves with attributes.

---

### Common Attributes
- **`controls`**: Adds play, pause, volume, and other controls to the video.
    ```html
    <video controls>
    ```
- **`autoplay`**: Makes the video play automatically when the page loads.
    ```html
    <video autoplay>
    ```
- **`loop`**: Plays the video on repeat.
    ```html
    <video loop>
    ```
- **`muted`**: Starts the video with no sound.
    ```html
    <video muted>
    ```
- **`poster`**: Displays an image before the video starts playing (like a thumbnail).
    ```html
    <video poster="thumbnail.jpg">
    ```
- **`width` and `height`**: Sets the size of the video player.
    ```html
    <video width="640" height="360">
    ```

---

### Adding Video Files
To include a video, use the `<source>` tag inside the `<video>` tag. This lets you specify:
- **`src`**: Path to the video file.
- **`type`**: Format of the video file.

Example:
```html
<video controls>
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

---

### Fallback Text
If a browser doesnâ€™t support the `<video>` tag, you can display a message:
```html
<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

---

### Supported Formats
Not all browsers support all video formats. Here are common ones:
- **MP4 (H.264)**: Widely supported.
- **WebM**: Open-source format.
- **Ogg**: Another open-source option.

---

### Example with Everything
```html
<video controls autoplay loop muted poster="thumbnail.jpg" width="640" height="360">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

This example includes controls, plays automatically, loops, starts muted, has a thumbnail, and specifies multiple formats for compatibility.

---

### Advanced Features
1. **JavaScript API**: You can control videos with JavaScript (e.g., play, pause, adjust volume).
    ```javascript
    const video = document.querySelector("video");
    video.play();  // Start playing
    video.pause(); // Pause video
    ```
2. **Custom Controls**: You can create your own controls using JavaScript and hide the default controls.

---

### Browser Support
All modern browsers support the `<video>` tag, but older versions might not. Always test your video on different browsers.

That's the `<video>` tag in a nutshell! Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any part. ðŸ˜Š
