    <!-- poem -->
     <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land, <br/>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
        stand in the desert. . . . Near them , on the sand,  <br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br/>
        And wrinkeled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br/>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passion read <br/>
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br/>
        the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br/>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br/>
        My name is <span> Ozymandias </span>, King of kings; <br/>
        look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
        of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br/>
        the lone and level sands streach far away. " <br/> 
     </p>
