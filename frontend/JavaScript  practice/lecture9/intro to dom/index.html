    <h1> Intro to Dom </h1>
    <h2> (DOM) = Document Object MOdel</h2>
    <p>The Dom represents a document with a logical tree</p>
    <p>It allows us to manipulate webpage content (HTML element)</p>

    <pre>
        <span>// every single html element becomes an object in javascript</span>
        <span>If we do some changes on that object ex i want to do some changes in body then we have to access the body object then manuplate them  </span>
        <span>// this changes reflected in the html document </span>

        <span>// why do we say document object ?</span>
        <span>// like we have a default(in built) window object exist(automatically generated)</span>
        <span>// like this for every single webpage where html exist our document object is generated tis is another object which javaScript generate automatically</span>
        <span>//if we do some changes in that document object it will reflect in html document</span>

        console.dir(document);
    </pre>
